TODO
====
- [GraphImage] Complete class - handle corner cases
- [GraphIO] Unit tests
- [Agent Distribution] Allow for leader placement
- [Graph Visualization] Use GraphStream events model for updating display
- [tinylog] Option to have logs written to both console and log file
- [CSS] Add sprite to show direction of traversal for undirected graphs
- [CSS] Change the size of the label for when graph is really dense
- [gh-pages] Add experiments section
- Make max time step proportional to number of agents
- Status level logging (above INFO) - SHIFT down to debug - make status INFO
- Params class to simplify Simulator class - like GraphStream PlotParams?
- More ranged options - action probabilities, number of nodes, etc
- Update to NIO
- Simulation run dir - have additional counter label for easier cd
- Check for self edges in a graph?
- Complete and add scripts (make_movie.sh, etc)
- Do package-info.java
- Implement ExtendedEdge class - have edge weights
- Should conversions & metFollowers of an agent reset if infected?
- Look into OpenGL, DirectX, and Quartz Java system properties
- Add d3.js or nvd3.js charts and report?
- Figure out why gradle daemon prevents build becoming a background process
- ChainGen graph slower than hand made version?
- README gif file size large, makes page a bit slow
- Add sim version to metadata.json
- Where does most of the action occur?
- Vis label - infection counter
- For Agent dist even spread, compute once
- Opt nextWeightedNode - iterator, node vs string id, etc
